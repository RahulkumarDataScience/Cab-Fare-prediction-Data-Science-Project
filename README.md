# Cab-Fare-prediction-Data-Science-Project
Edwisor project challenge on predicting Cab Fare 

Problem Statement
---------------------
You want to launch your cab service across the country. You have collected the historical data from your pilot project and now have a requirement to apply analytics for fare prediction. You need to design a system that predicts the fare amount for a cab ride in the city. 

Variables Details
------------------

 pickup_datetime - timestamp value indicating when the cab ride started.
 pickup_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the cab ride
 started.
 pickup_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the cab ride started.
 dropoff_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the cab ride
 ended.
 dropoff_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the cab ride ended.
 passenger_count - an integer indicating the number of passengers in the cab
 ride. 

Solution
------------
The data is a Time-Series data but instead we will approach it as Regression Problem.Our task is to build a regression model which will predict the fare of the cab facility using MACHINE LEARNING models like KNN, Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Gradient Boost Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression. Thus, comparing each model to know which is best for this problem suite.
